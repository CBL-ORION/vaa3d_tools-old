Version history of TeraManager
================================

Below you find a list with the added features, changes and fixes for each version.

Version 0.2.2
July 24th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).

Version 0.2.1
July 21st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).
- New: "Select ROI with Vaa3D" feature added. If the user defines a ROI with right-stroke or
       right-click from the 3D renderer right-menu, then the correspondent VOI is loaded and
       shown in a new global view.
- New: "Zoom-in" feature added. If the user defines a marker with the Vaa3D built-in feature
       (one, two or three right-click) and then zooms-in, the VOI  surrounding  the selected 
       point is loaded and displayed in the same renderer. When the user zooms-out, the ori-
       ginal map view is restored. VOI dimensions can be set from the GUI.
- New: "3D mode" added. When a volume is imported, the  plugin searches for a "good for map"
       low resolution volume  to be shown and used as a 3D map.  At this  moment, there is a
       threshold, defined by the macro TMP_VMAP_MAXSIZE, to limit the size of the volume map
       to be loaded.

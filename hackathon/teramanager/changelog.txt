Version history of TeraManager
============================================================================================

Below you find a list with the added  features, changes and fixes  for each version. Activi-
ties names are:
- New: a new feature to be implemented
- Bug: bug to be fixed
- Dev: for developers only

============================================================================================
Version 0.5.1
November 26th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: color map changes are propagated when switching between different resolutions in the
       multiresolution mode.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5.0
November 4th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: colored images are now supported.
- Fix: image loading has been slightly optimized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.4.1
September 21st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: The registration between consecutive resolutions did not work well when the window is
       resized. This bug has been fixed.
- New: The TeraManager window is now juxtaposed to  the navigation window and  each resizing
       or moving event on the navigation window affects also the TeraManager window.
- New: texture compression has been disabled to enhance the rendering quality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.4
September 2nd, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Google Earth" feature released! The 3D exploration of the volume uses all the avail-
       able resolutions to enable a  "Google-Earth" like experience.  Transitions  to higher
       resolutions are available by:
         1) creating a Vaa3D marker in the image space and zooming-in
         2) 1-right-stroke ROI Vaa3D right-menu function
         3) 1-right-click ROI Vaa3D right-menu function
         4) VOI's precise selection (see "Precise VOI selection" feature)
       When the highest  resolution is  reached, these functions can be used to move  to an-
       other volume of interest within the same (highest) resolution.
       Volumes of interest (except for 4) have size 200x200x50 but it  can be  modified from  
       the GUI. This setting is automatically saved when the plugin is closed.
       Transitions to the higher resolution are fast (< 2 seconds on a midrange PC), whereas
       transitions  to the lower resolution are instantaneous and they  occurs when the user
       zooms out. Both transitions generate views registered each other in terms of orienta-
       tion, zoom and position of the window containing the 3D renderer.
- New: "Precise VOI selection" feature released. The user can select  a volume  of  interest 
       with 1-voxel precision using the plugin VOI spinboxes or the Vaa3D volume cut scroll-
       bars, if the "Google Earth" feature is enabled. If Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars change
       also TeraManager VOI spinboxes change and viceversa.  TeraManager  VOI spinboxes have
       values in the highest resolution volume space, while Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars have
       values in the local image space of the resolution shown in that moment. A syncroniza-
       tion mechanism takes this into account. 
       The selected VOI is always loaded from the highest resolution volume.
- New: "Resolution" GUI field which shows infos about the current active resolution.
- New: "Zoom-in VOI size" field which shows  the size (in MVoxels) of  the VOI  to be loaded
       from the higher resolution.
- New: the "Load" button of the "Precise VOI selection" feature  shows the size (in MVoxels)
       of the VOI to be loaded from the highest resolution.
- New: the plugin GUI is automatically positioned as an "extension" of the 3D renderer, when
       the "Google Earth" feature is enabled.   
- New: the VHD (Vertical, Horizontal, Depth) reference system has been changed into the same
       used by Vaa3D: XYZ (Horizontal, Vertical, Depth).

Version 0.3
August 27th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Google Earth" feature (preliminary version) released.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.4
August 19th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: some preliminary work to enable the Google Earth feature
- New: all  application  settings are now  persistent between different runs. In particular, 
       the plugin is now able to remember the last opened volume. 
- Fix: redesigning of the import form panel of the gui (the  useless  field  displaying  the
       selected directory has been removed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.3
August 18th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added a spinbox to control the size limit for the volume map and a checkbox to regen-
       erate the volume map with the selected size limit.
- Dev: the multiresolution volume import lost in July 20th 2012 for the SVN problem has been
       reestabilished. When a volume is imported, all the other resolutions available in the
       parent folder are imported too in order to enable a "Google-Earth" feature.
- Fix: runtime detection of OpenCV library has been disabled. It didn't work  on MAC OS sys-
       tems. In order to be fixed, this should be tested on a MAC OS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.2
July 24th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.1
July 21st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).
- New: "Select ROI with Vaa3D" feature added. If the user defines a ROI with right-stroke or
       right-click from the 3D renderer right-menu, then the correspondent VOI is loaded and
       shown in a new global view.
- New: "Zoom-in" feature added. If the user defines a marker with the Vaa3D built-in feature
       (one, two or three right-click) and then zooms-in, the VOI  surrounding  the selected 
       point is loaded and displayed in the same renderer. When the user zooms-out, the ori-
       ginal map view is restored. VOI dimensions can be set from the GUI.
- New: "3D mode" added. When a volume is imported, the  plugin searches for a "good for map"
       low resolution volume  to be shown and used as a 3D map.  At this  moment, there is a
       threshold, defined by the macro TMP_VMAP_MAXSIZE, to limit the size of the volume map
       to be loaded.

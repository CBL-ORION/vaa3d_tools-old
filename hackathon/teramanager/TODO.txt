TODO list of TeraManager
================================

Below you can find a list of the  features to be implemented as soon as  possible in respect
with the associated priorities(P) which have values in the range [1-9]. Activities names are
- New: a new feature to be implemented
- Bug: bug to be fixed
- Dev: for developers only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P9 New: extend the "Select ROI with Vaa3D" feature  by replicating  the same user experience
        of the selection of a ROI in a non-Teramanager 3D renderer. The generated VOI should
        be shown into a local viewer instead  of a global viewer and the user should be able
        to explore the volume by moving from  the selected VOI  to another one surrounding a
        new ROI selectable within the actual VOI view.
P9 Bug: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars"  feature  should generate a new global 
        view instead of using the same renderer.
P9 Bug: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars": the syncronization between Vaa3D ren-
        derer volume cut scrollbars and Teramanager spinboxes does not always work well. So-
        metimes Vaa3D does not use the actual size of the map, and it seems it is working on
        a downsampled version.
P8 New: add some fields to the GUI to show the size (in MVoxels) of the selected VOIs.
P7 New: enable the "Google-Earth" feature by extending the "Zoom-in" feature and exploiting
        the multiresolution import.
P7 New: the plugin should remember the last opened directory.
P6 New: provide some help to the user when the volume is imported for the first time.
P5 Dev: refine the registration between volume map and zoomed-in subvolume.
P4 Dev: substitute the absolute thresholds used to detect the zoom-in and zoom-out actions
        with ones relative to the ratio between the map and the higher resolution volume. It
        seems that absolute thresholds work well with many volumes, so it maybe that no fur-
        ther intervents will be done in respect to this feature.

TODO list of TeraManager
================================

Below you can find a list of the  features to be implemented as soon as  possible in respect
with the associated priorities(P) which have values in the range [1-9]. Activities names are
- New: a new feature to be implemented
- Bug: bug to be fixed
- Dev: for developers only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P6 New: provide some help to the user when the volume is imported for the first time.
P4 Dev: substitute the absolute thresholds used to detect the zoom-in and zoom-out actions
        with ones relative to the ratio between the map and the higher resolution volume. It
        seems that absolute thresholds work well with many volumes, so it maybe that no fur-
        ther intervents will be done in respect to this feature.

To build this plugin, just following the normal Vaa3D plugin's qmake and make procedure.

To run, you need to download the Loci bioformat jar file from: http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads

and also ensure you have java on your machine.

You need to copy the downloaded file "loci_tools.jar" to the Vaa3D executable folder (i.e. where you will find 'vaa3d', or 'vaa3d.exe', or 'vaa3d64.app', depending on your OS.)

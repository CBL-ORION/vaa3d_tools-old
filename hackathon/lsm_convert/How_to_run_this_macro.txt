To run the macro, simply do this:
1. Prepare all your lsm files in one folder
	**Make sure the folder contain ONLY lsm files (no other files, no subfolders!!)**
2. start Fiji
3. click Plugins->Macros->Run...
4. choose this bioformat_lsm.ijm
5. It will pomp a window "Choose a Directory", choose your lsm-containing folder

The macro will automatically create a folder called "converted" under your lsm folder. You will find all your converted tif files there, with each channel stored in "<yourfilename>_c<ChannelNum>.tif"

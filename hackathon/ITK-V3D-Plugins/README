When run ccmake, should use this folder as the source root. That is, make
a folder outside this folder, say "build", enter it, and run the command

	ccmake ../ITK-V3D-Plugins

Also we added a preference file for storing the ccmake variables such as 
ITK_DIR and V3D_BINARY_PATH, etc to the file 

	env_variable_pref.txt

Then you need to copy the env_variable_pref.txt file to a *different* location
(so that you won't change this file incidentally). Now you can run cmake by
running the command

	cmake -c /path_to/env_variable_pref.txt /path_to_plugin_src

Note that "path_to_plugin_src" in this case should be "../ITK-V3D-Plugins".



If we do this, then we don't need to run manual ccmake again and again!
**********************************************************
way to build the V3D_ITK_PLUGIN:
you can just use command "bash build.sh" to build the plugins(just to set the path to basic_c_fun and the path to binary folder) or just make it as follows:
	1.build ITK library
note that you should make ITK_USE_REVIEW on. You can just run the command
	mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DITK_USE_REVIEW=ON ../path_to_ITK_src
then build the ITK libraries
	make
if your os is mac, and you also want to build plugins in 64-bit, make sure your compiler is gnu gcc and the version should be higher than 4.2.0. 
	2.set the value of all the paths in the plugin_src/Toolchain.cmake, paths are as follows:
	ITK_DIR, path where you build you ITK libraries
	V3D_BINARY_DIR, path where the plugins should be placed
	V3D_BASIC_C_FUN_SOURCE_DIR, path to the v3d_main/basic_c_fun/.
if you want to specify the build type, you can add one line:
	set (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release or Debug)
	3.mkdir new_folder outside the source and cd new_folder
	4.cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../path_to_plugin_src/Toolchain.cmake ../path_to_plugin_src
then build it
	make
Note that plath_to_plugin_src this case should be "ITK-V3D-Plugins".
you gcc version should be higher than 4.2.0
ITK version 4.1.0

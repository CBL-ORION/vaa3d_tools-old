When run ccmake, should use this folder as the source root. That is, make
a folder outside this folder, say "build", enter it, and run the command

	ccmake ../ITK-V3D-Plugins

Also we added a preference file for storing the ccmake variables such as 
ITK_DIR and V3D_BINARY_PATH, etc to the file 

	env_variable_pref.txt

Then you need to copy the env_variable_pref.txt file to a *different* location
(so that you won't change this file incidentally). Now you can run cmake by
running the command

	cmake -c /path_to/env_variable_pref.txt /path_to_plugin_src

Note that "path_to_plugin_src" in this case should be "../ITK-V3D-Plugins".



If we do this, then we don't need to run manual ccmake again and again!
**********************************************************
way to build the V3D_ITK_PLUGIN(Mac and Linux):
you can just use command "bash build.sh" to build the plugins(just to set the path to vaa3d source folder) or just make it as follows:
	1.build ITK library
note that you should make ITK_USE_REVIEW on. You can just run the command
	mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DITK_USE_REVIEW=ON ../path_to_ITK_src
then build the ITK libraries
	make
if your os is mac, and you also want to build plugins in 64-bit, make sure your compiler is gnu gcc and the version should be higher than 4.2.0. 
	2.set the value of all the paths in the plugin_src/Toolchain.cmake, paths are as follows:
	ITK_DIR, path where you build you ITK libraries
	V3D_BINARY_DIR, path where the plugins should be placed
	V3D_BASIC_C_FUN_SOURCE_DIR, path to the v3d_main/basic_c_fun/.
if you want to specify the build type, you can add one line:
	set (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release or Debug)
	3.mkdir new_folder outside the source and cd new_folder
	4.cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../path_to_plugin_src/Toolchain.cmake ../path_to_plugin_src
then build it
	make
Note that plath_to_plugin_src this case should be "ITK-V3D-Plugins".
you gcc version should be higher than 4.2.0
ITK version 4.1.0
***********************************************************
way to build Vaa3D-ITK-Plugins on windows(under msvc 2008 x64):
We expect you have installed msvc 2008 x64 and cmake (version higher than 2.8.0);
	1. build ITK library.
		*Extract InsightToolkit-4.1.0.tar.gz in the ITK-V3D_Plugins' folder.
		*Make a new build folder outside the ITK source folder (such as "ITK_build")
		*Run cmake-gui programe
		*Click "Browse Source" button and set the value of source folder as the path where you extracted the ITK source (such as “C:/ITK/InsightToolkit-4.1.0")
 		*Click "Browse Build" button and set the value of build folder as the path where you just made, which is the new build folder （such as "C:/ITK/ITK_build")
		*Click "Configure" button to configure
		*Click "Generate" button to generate the msvc 2008 x64 project file
		*Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 x64 to open the project file in the build folder( such as "C:/ITK/ITK_build")
		*Compile it use compiler in msvc 2008(Just press the F7 button)
	2. build Vaa3d-ITK-Plugins
		*Make a new build folder outside the Vaa3D-ITK-Plugins' source folder (such as "plugins_build")
		*Run cmake-gui programe(delete the cache before)
		*Click "Browse Source" button and set the value of source folder as the path where your Vaa3D-ITK-plugin source place(such as "C:/ITK-V3D-Plugins/")
		*Click "Browse Build" button and set the value of build folder as the path where you just made,  which is the new build folder （such as "C:/ITK/plugins_build")
		*Click "Configure" button to configure the sourch file;
		*After configure you may meet with some problems. you should set the right paths as follows:
			ITK_DIR, path where you build you ITK libraries (such as "C:/ITK/ITK_build")
			V3D_BINARY_DIR, path where the plugins should be placed (such as "C:/vaa3d/bin")
			V3D_BASIC_C_FUN_SOURCE_DIR, path to the v3d_main/basic_c_fun (such as "C:/vaa3d/v3d_main/basic_c_fun")
		*Click "Generate" button to create the msvc 2008 x64 project file
		*Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 x64 to open the project file in the build folder( such as "C:/ITK/plugins_build")
		*Compile it use compiler in msvc 2008 (Just press the F7 button);
After you compile it correctly, the plugins will be moved to the folder of your vaa3d binary folder automaicly. So just run vaa3d and test it.

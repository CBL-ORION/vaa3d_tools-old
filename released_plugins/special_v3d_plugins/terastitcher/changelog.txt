============================================================================================
Version 1.0.4
June 1st, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: new parameters are now stored into XML files while  guaranteeing at the same time the
       retrocompatibility with the old XML files.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused  reliability measures  not 100% correct when the search region
       was bigger than 30 x 30 x 30.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0.3
May 31st, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added "Step successfully performed!" message when a step is successfully performed.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused stitched volume not to be opened in Vaa3D in "Basic mode" when
       a resolution was selected to be opened in Vaa3D with "Open" checkbox.
- New: added "Advanced options" button in "Aligning" and "Merging" tabs.
- Fix: fixed bug in the "Projecting" tab which caused XML output path to be  incorrectly up-
       dated after the step was performed.
- Fix: "Basic mode" is enabled by default (previously it was "Advanced mode").
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0.2
May 30th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed compilation issue on MacOS X.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0.1
May 29th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which  caused incompatible XML files  (not signaled by any error message)
       when saving/loading  to/from different  platform/O.S. combinations (i.e. the "locale"
       problem). This caused real numbers (such as displacements or reliability measures) to
       be incorretcly read/written.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.0.0
May 26th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: input of reference system and voxel  dimensions when a volume has  to be  imported is
       now constrained by a limited set of choices available  through a  pull-down  menu for
       the axes and a spinbox for volume dimension.
- New: added "Options->Mode->Basic", "Options->Mode->Advanced". In "Basic" mode only 3 steps
       have to be performed ("Importing", "Aligning", "Merging")  and most of  the  advanced
       settings are hidden. In this way, stitching  under "Basic"  mode is much simpler than
       before. 
- New: added menubar.
- New: VHD convention changed to XYZ.
- New: interface has been re-designed to fit into 800x600 window.
- New: added "What's this?" helpbox.

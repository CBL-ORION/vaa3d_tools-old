* Instruction of creating a Vaa3D plugin for neuron reconstruction
(version 1, Feb 2015)

* Prerequisites:

This instruction assumes you have or can build the latest Vaa3D program as well as the Vaa3D plugin-creator tool (which is a Vaa3D plugin). You will need to make both tools ready before you start the following procedure.

* Step-by-step instruction:

1. Launch Vaa3D, in the main menu, go to “Plug-In” click “_Vaa3D_plugin_creator”, then click “create plugin for neuron reconstruction”

2. From the “Plugin Creator Dialog”, you can define “Plugin Name”, “Plugin Class Name”, “Window Title”, “Plugin Description”, “Plugin Date”, “Plugin Author”, “Menu List’, ‘Func List”, and the path of the “Save Folder”.
Please note: the “Vaa3D whole-project path” should be the “v3d_external” folder, which is checked out from https://svn.janelia.org/penglab/projects/vaa3d/trunk. For Mac and Linux, the path will be automatically detected. But for Windows, the user may have to manually choose the right location (the detected one may not be correct).

3. After selecting the correct path, clicking “ok” button will automatically generate three files (*.pro, *.cpp, and *.h). These files will be saved to “Save Folder” directory.

4. In a command line window, enter the specified “Save Folder” directory, and use the following commands (blue parts) to build your neuron reconstruction plugin template code.

>qmake
>make (Mac and Linux), or nmake –f Makefile.Release (Windows)

5. The neuron reconstruction plugin template created by the user can read an image, and generate an empty swc (neuron reconstruction format) file both in do_menu (GUI) and do_func (other than GUI, such as for command line use). The user can import his/her neuron reconstruction algorithm in the *.cpp file after the comments “//main neuron reconstruction code”.


* Example code:

Attached to this guide is the zipped source code of one example plugin generated by “create plugin for neuron reconstruction” to import all-path-pruning 2.0 (APP2) neuron reconstruction algorithm (Xiao and Peng, Bioinformatics, Vol. 29, No. 11, pp. 1448-1454, 2013. http://home.penglab.com/papersall/docpdf/2013_BIOINFO_app2.pdf). Note, when you try to build this example as a Vaa3D plugin, you might need to change the folder paths in the APP2_ported.pro file to point to the correct Vaa3D source code folder on your computer.

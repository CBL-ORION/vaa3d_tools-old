Application notes:
Matlab version:
Please use Matlab 2014a 32bit version


How to trace a series of images

in matlab:

1 Type SeriesAnalysisAxon

2 go to menu item file->open images

Pick a list of image files or spi files


2.1 If they are tif files, go to analyze analyze

2.2 close the application

2.3 go to 1 again and this time select the spi files that are generated.


3 click on the first file in the list on the main panel, press next pair

4 Analyze and edit the two images, the most important is to place markers on each axon for alignment.

5 Enter an axon number in each panel and press Align on the main panel to see the alignment is satisfactory. Do it for axons present in each image.

6 click on second file in the list on the main panel, press next pair

7 iterate step 4-6 until done

8 click on the last file in the list, press next pair

9 press seriestrace bouton

10 Select a database file to write to, to create a new database file, click cancel
You can save the analysis results of related experiments to the same database file

11 Enter the distance tolerance for boutons to be considered the same.

12 Are you happy with the alignment. If you press no, you can reenter the distance tolerance and exclude dendrite ranges

13 If you said no, do you want to exclude dendrite range from the analysis, this can happen if there is a badly imaged area

14 When you are happy with the alignment, Do you want to save to database? Normally yes

15 your analysis resutls are now saved,
   Across day intensity data is also left on the clipboard which you can copy to the excel datasheet.
 you can also copy the summary figures to excel datasheet.
